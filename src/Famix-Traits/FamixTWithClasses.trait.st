### Children
| Relation | Origin | Opposite | Type | Comment |
|---|
| `types` | `FamixTWithTypes` | `typeContainer` | `FamixTType` | Types contained (declared) in this entity, if any. #types is declared in ContainerEntity because different kinds of container can embed types. Types are usually contained in a Famix.Namespace. But types can also be contained in a Famix.Class or Famix.Method (in Java with inner classes for example). Famix.Function can also contain some types such as structs.|
