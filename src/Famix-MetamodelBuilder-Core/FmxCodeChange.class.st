Description
--------------------

I am an abstract class representing a code changes.

I am used by the Famix Generator to represent a change the generator need to apply during a generation and I can be applied.

I am useful because the generator will be able to create the list of changes to apply and apply them. Doing the separation allows us to implement new features such as a method to know if a generator would have impact if we need to regenerate.
